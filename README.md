### Background

It will hold the 1st Medical Artificial Intelligence (MAI) Competition, which aims to solve problems based on pre-provided medical data using artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

The goal of this competition is to expand the base of AI use in the medical field and strengthen participants' artificial intelligence capabilities to efficiently analyze complex medical data and verify their ability to produce desired outcomes.

The competition is designed to increase the utilization of medical data, thereby maximizing the applicability of AI technology in the medical field, and further promote the willingness of artificial intelligence researchers to research and develop.

The aim is to explore how AI technologies utilizing medical data can contribute to solving real-world problems.

### Topic

Prediction of gene expression from H&E stained tissue images

### Description

We need to develop an AI model that takes H&E-stained tissue images as input and predicts gene expression data from those images.

The training data provided is accompanied by image and gene expression information, which requires the model to learn the relationship between image and gene expression.

In the evaluation stage, new images that are not provided with gene expression information should be received as input and the gene expression profile should be predicted.
